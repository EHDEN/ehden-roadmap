# EHDEN Roadmap

## Contributing to the roadmap
### Add a new project for consideration
Anyone can add a new proposed project to the roadmap:
1. Create a new issue in the [/ehden-roadmap](https://github.com/ehden/ehden-roadmap) repository.
2. Add the issue to the [project board](https://github.com/ehden/ehden-roadmap/projects/1)
3. Add it to the "Inbox" column in the board
 
### Prioritization
When a new project is created, it will be placed in the **Inbox** column. As the project received feedback, the scope is defined and clarified it will be in the **Discussion** column. When the scope has been defined and an EHDEN partner is willing to execute the project, the card is moved to the **Committed** column. The subsequent **In Development** and **Done** columns indicate the development status.

Cards in each column of on the board will sorted by the number of comments, the cards with the highest number of comments being at the top.
